![R-L relation](/results/all_fitting.pdf)

## Usage
This repository contains the source code used for the study of spatial extension of AGN narrow line region. The structure of this repository is summarized in [Main.ipynb](Main.ipynb)

To make all the code work properly, you should install all the packages:

```text
numpy >= 1.16
scipy >= 1.2
matplotlib >= 3.0
jupyter >= 1.0.0
astropy >= 3.0
PyNeb == 1.1.7
photutils == 0.6
```

and have the public available data from [SDSS/MaNGA(DR15)](https://www.sdss.org/dr15/) locally, you can download all the fits files directly from [Science Archive Server](https://www.sdss.org/dr15/manga/spectro/) or explore it online with [Marvin](https://dr15.sdss.org/marvin/).
